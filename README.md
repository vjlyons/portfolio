# Welcome!
My name is Veronica, and this is my catch-all portfolio with data analysis and data science projects I've completed over the years.  Most projects have been written in Python (my first coding language), but I hope to add projects written in other languages as well.

Project topics range from professional to personal interests - please feel free to provide constructive comments regarding my coding and visualization techniques.  I am always looking to learn!
## Enjoy!
